## About Me

- 🔭 Currently, I'm immersed in a data project centered around education.
- 🌱 Engrossed in "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists" by Peter Bruce & Andrew Bruce and "The Women" by Kristin Hannah.
- 💬 Proud parent of two adorable fur babies! Their daily walks are the highlight of my day.
- 🏞️ From Moses Lake to Seattle, I was raised on Seahawks games and knew Seattle was destined to be my home.
- 🏃‍♂️ Ask me about the last time I attempted to run a marathon but left my shoes in my friend's car!
